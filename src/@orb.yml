version: 2.1
description: |
  Allows jobs or entire workflows to be queued to ensure they run in serial.  
  This is ideal for deployments or other activities that must not run concurrently.
  May optionaly consider branch-level isolation if unique branches should run concurrently. 
  This orb requires the project to have an API to query build statuses.

examples:
  queue_workflow:
    description: Used typically as first job and will queue until no jobs from a previous workflow are running
    usage:
      version: 2.1
      orbs:
        queue: eddiewebb/queue@volatile

      workflows:
        build_deploy:
          jobs:
            - queue/block_workflow:
                time: "10"                # max wait, in minutes (default 10)
                only-on-branch: master  # restrict queueing to a specific branch (default *)
            - some_other_job:
                requires:
                  - queue/block_workflow
           
  single_concurrency_job:
    description: Used to ensure that a single job (deploy) is not run concurrently
    usage:
      version: 2.1
      orbs:
        queue: eddiewebb/queue@volatile

      workflows:
        build_deploy:
          jobs:
            - build
            - deploy:
                requires:
                  - build
      jobs:
        build:
          docker:
            - image: circleci/node:10
          steps:
            - run: echo "This job can overlap"

        deploy:
          docker:
            - image: circleci/node:10
          steps:
            - queue/until_front_of_line:
                time: "10"                # max wait, in minutes (default 10)
                only-on-branch: master  # restrict queueing to a specific branch (default *)
            - run: echo "This job will not overlap"
